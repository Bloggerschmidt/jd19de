# JD19DE

Main template of JoomlaDay™ Germany 2019 in Gießen.

## How to use

This template is for local developing under [Node.js®](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). A good workflow is to code your template on localhost and if it is ready to deploy it on the live server (e.g. copy via sftp). And for shure, you should have a [Joomla!™](https://www.joomla.org/) installation ready for this.

## Install

If Node.js® is installed, install Gulp via command prompt (e.g. console or terminal).

    npm install -g gulp

Install BL4NK like a normal template in Joomla!™. Open your command prompt and go to the template directory. Install all dependencies.

    npm install

Run Gulp to compile, compress and build

    gulp

See the magic happen on your command line if you edit some files.
